         <p>Lasagna, also known by the plural form lasagne, is a type of pasta made in very wide, flat sheets</p>
        <p>The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which melts during baking. Typically cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven. The resulting dish is cut into single-serving square or rectangular portions.</p>
